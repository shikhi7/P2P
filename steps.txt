1. establish a network between two nodes.
  1.1 define members for Node class and methods.
    1.1.1 successor, predecessor, fingertable, file table
    1.1.2 updating points and tables
    1.1.3 hashing tech
  1.2 how does one node know about any node of the network? For now assume new
  node is given an id by the some DNS based on its hash and returns a pointer
  to one of the nodes in the network. Now the new node will search for its
  position the the ring and when found adjusts itself there.
  1.3. Update the pointers and tables on insertion.
  1.4 Leave failure of nodes for now.
  1.5. COMMANDS TO ADDRESS:
    1.5.1 printFingerTable
    1.5.2 putContent
    1.5.3 getContent
    1.5.4 leave [put hold to it]
2. expand above to N nodes.
3. File sharing.
